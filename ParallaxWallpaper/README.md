# Inactive project

Feel free to make use of this code in any way you like, but I haven't looked at it in years and it probably doesn't work very well and will not be able to provide support for you, especially over Twitter. Have fun!

# Parallax live wallpapers

This is a basic Android app that provides customisable multi-layer wallpapers.
Android wallpapers already have a parallax effect with the icons and the wallpaper
scrolling at different rates as you swipe left and right. The main difference here
is that you can have multiple images all moving at different speeds.
You provide a series of images of varying widths (usually on your SD card),
select them, and they will be displayed together. All the images except the back one
need to have some amount of transparency or else you won't be able to see what's behind
them, so they will probably be 32-bit PNG files. 

## Potential improvements

* Save previously used layer sets for easy re-use
* Support layers packed into a single file
* An online gallery to choose some nice ready made sets

Done:

* OpenGL acceleration
* A more sensible settings screen
* A proper thumbnail icon
